# Learning Python - Tony Gaddis "Starting Out with Python" (4th Edition)

This repository contains my solutions to the programming exercises from the book **"Starting Out with Python" by Tony Gaddis (4th Edition)**.

> **Note:** This repository contains only the Programming Exercises found at the end of each chapter. Review Questions and Checkpoint questions are not included.

Every single line of code in this repository was written by me manually. No AI generation, no copy-pasting.

## Why This Repository?

I created this repo to:
- Track my learning progress chapter by chapter
- Build consistency and discipline in coding
- Practice writing code from scratch without relying on AI

## My Learning Rules

1. **Type every line manually** - no copy pasting
2. **No AI assistance** for solving problems
3. **1 hour minimum** of coding every single day
4. **Fix my own errors** before asking for help
5. **Understand before moving on** - never skip exercises

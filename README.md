# Learning Python - Tony Gaddis "Starting Out with Python" (4th Edition)

This repository contains my solutions to the programming exercises from the book **"Starting Out with Python" by Tony Gaddis (4th Edition)**.

Every single line of code in this repository was written by me manually. No AI generation, no copy-pasting.

## Why This Repository?

I created this repo to:
- Track my learning progress chapter by chapter
- Build consistency and discipline in coding
